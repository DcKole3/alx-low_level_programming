What is <code>main</code>; how to print text using printf, puts and putchar; how to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator <code>sizeof</code> and how to compile using <code>gcc</code>. 
 	Also, what the default program name when compiling with gcc and what the official C coding style a
is and in what way to check the code with betty-style. Additionally, how to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function and how the main function influence the return value of the program will be covered.
